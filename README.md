# Morten_Portfolio
The following projects are the ones I have done during training exercises with added functions as I have learned more.
I have done a Siemens Gamesa course on Python and a couple of Udemy clases where I am currently doing the 100 days of code course.


# [Project 1 - Data illustrating techniques](https://github.com/MortenRatzer/Morten_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Data%20illustration%20techniques) 
This project includes examples of illustrations that I have created during learning sessions. 

1. Scatter plot to showcase trends of data

# [Project 2 - Test if numbers have a perfect square number](https://github.com/MortenRatzer/Morten_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20Test%20if%20numbers%20have%20a%20perfect%20square%20number) 
This project includes a tester I build using while loops and several if statements to see if numbers have a perfect square root.

# [Project 3 - Bidding on a house procedure](https://github.com/MortenRatzer/Morten_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%203%20-%20Bidding%20on%20a%20house%20procedure) 
This project includes a while loop to test whether a seller of a house would accept bids from a potential buyer.

# [Project 4 - Humanoid intelligence tester](https://github.com/MortenRatzer/Morten_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%204%20-%20Humanoid%20intelligence%20tester) 
This project includes a while loop to test whether a seller of a house would accept bids from the user of the code. Feel free to test your intelligens level according to this tester.

# [Project 5 - Employee library with search function](https://github.com/MortenRatzer/Morten_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%205%20-%20Employee%20library%20with%20search%20function) 
This project includes a list of employess that needed to be sorted out. Then I added a search function to find a dear colleague.

First I made a list of employees and some variables to each colleague, being name, age, and department.

Then I printed out a better overview of the employees:

At last I made a search in the list of coleaguess for the old guy named Asger.

# [Project 6 - Time count function](https://github.com/MortenRatzer/Morten_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%206%20-%20Time%20count%20function) 
This project includes a time counter to showcase functions working over time.

# [Project 7 - Number sorting function](https://github.com/MortenRatzer/Morten_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%207%20-%20Number%20sorting%20function) 
This project includes number sorting function that can sort out a list of integers into a correct numeric order.

Input:
